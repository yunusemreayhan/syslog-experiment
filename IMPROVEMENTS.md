# Syslog Experiment - Improvements and Fixes

## Issues Fixed

1. **Port Configuration**
   - Fixed port conflict in podman-compose.yml
   - Moved port exposure to receiver container (which actually listens on 514)
   - Server now only connects to receiver internally

2. **Container Dependencies**
   - Added health check for receiver container
   - Server now waits for receiver to be healthy before starting
   - Added restart policies for reliability

3. **Syslog-ng Version**
   - Changed from version 3.38 to 3.28 for better compatibility with Debian Bullseye

4. **Missing Directories**
   - Created server/logs and receiver/logs directories
   - Added to .gitignore to prevent committing log files

## New Features Added

1. **Makefile**
   - Easy-to-use commands for common operations
   - Includes build, up, down, logs, clean, and shell access
   - Run `make help` to see all available commands

2. **Test Scripts**
   - `test_syslog.sh` - Comprehensive testing with colored output
   - `verify_syslog.sh` - Quick verification of syslog functionality
   - Both scripts check container status and log generation

3. **Examples Directory**
   - `examples/send_custom_logs.sh` - Demonstrates sending custom syslog messages
   - Shows different severity levels, structured data, and JSON logs
   - Includes documentation on syslog priority calculations

4. **Enhanced Documentation**
   - Updated README with new usage instructions
   - Added examples section
   - Included Make commands for easier operation

## Usage Summary

1. **Quick Start**
   ```bash
   make up        # Start everything
   make logs      # Watch logs
   make down      # Stop everything
   ```

2. **Testing**
   ```bash
   ./test_syslog.sh       # Full test
   ./verify_syslog.sh     # Quick check
   ```

3. **Custom Logs**
   ```bash
   ./examples/send_custom_logs.sh  # Send example messages
   ```

## Key Improvements

- **Better Container Orchestration**: Health checks ensure proper startup order
- **Easier Management**: Makefile provides simple commands
- **Better Testing**: Multiple scripts for different testing scenarios
- **More Examples**: Practical examples for sending custom logs
- **Improved Documentation**: Clear instructions and examples

The project is now more robust, easier to use, and includes comprehensive testing capabilities.
